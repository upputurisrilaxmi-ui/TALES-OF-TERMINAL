# TALES-OF-TERMINAL
The code implements a Java Swing–based 2D grid adventure game where a player moves through a map, fights enemies, collects boosters, and reaches a destination. It uses event-driven programming, object-oriented principles, probability-based combat, basic enemy AI, inventory management, and file handling to create an interactive GUI game experience.
